<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Josep Jesus Bigorra Algaba</h1>

## How to work with Josep?

You might describe me as easy-going, hard-working, serious, committed, stubborn and fair.

After countless hours of dedication I have gained a lot of knowledge in the field, and consider myself a capable, responsible and organized Full Stack Developer. I like functional programming, but also have grown as a professional in the Object Oriented Paradigm, and can see when to use exactly what tool for what job. State can be important for front-end development, but APIs and back-end services should ideally be stateless.

My ideal position is somewhere I can learn something new every day, and where I am allowed the space to grow as a person and as a software engineer.

From custom made websites, RESTful APIs, databases, server side solutions, to mobile apps and desktop software I am ready to take on projects and help clients achieve their goals, considering business needs and best industry practices.

### My work hours:
I am a morning person, and like to start my day early and also finish early. Ideally I work from 7.30-8 until 16h. Of course being a Software Engineer I find myself spending more hours than I should sometimes.

### Whatâ€™s the best way to communicate with me?
I prefer to be pinged on Slack or emailed for small things, but I find calls and screen sharing simply work better for more complicated matters. Feel free to email me for anything :).

### I'd love to help you with
Go, Databases, REST APIs, CI pipelines in Groovy.

### What makes me grumpy?
Javascript frameworks, inconsistent APIs, non-normalized databases, colleagues that are not dedicated.


### Other things you might want to know:

* My favorite baked good: Bananenbrood
* My favourite beer: Difficult question.. La Chouffe, Tripel Karmeliet.
* My birthday: 23rd December
* Fruit on pizza? I must say I am positively surprised after a long denial period
* My coffee order: Zwarte koffie
* My hometown: Purmerend, The Netherlands
* Sports loyalties: Snorkeling
