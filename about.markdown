### I'm Josep Jesus Bigorra Algaba

### Me in 10 seconds

I am a software engineer specialized in back-end development with Go, MySQL, TypeScript, Java, Groovy, Shell scripting and NGINX configurations, as well as FreeBSD enthusiast and aspiring Jails and rc.d professional, and Linux connaisseur.

Spanish native, grew up in Portugal, I now live in The Netherlands.

## More about me

You might describe me as easy-going, hard-working, serious, committed, stubborn and fair.

After countless hours of dedication I have gained a lot of knowledge in the field, and consider myself a capable, responsible and organized Full Stack Developer. I like functional programming, but also have grown as a professional in the Object Oriented Paradigm, and can see when to use exactly what tool for what job. State can be important for front-end development, but APIs and back-end services should ideally be stateless.

My ideal position is somewhere I can learn something new every day, and where I am allowed the space to grow as a person and as a software engineer.

From custom made websites, RESTful APIs, databases, server side solutions, to mobile apps and desktop software I am ready to take on projects and help clients achieve their goals, considering business needs and best industry practices.

### My work hours
I am a morning person, and like to start my day early and also finish early. Ideally I work from 7.30-8 until 16h. Of course being a Software Engineer I find myself spending more hours than I should sometimes.

### Whatâ€™s the best way to communicate with me?
I prefer to be pinged on Slack or emailed for small things, but I find calls and screen sharing simply work better for more complicated matters. Feel free to email me for anything :).

### I'd love to help you with
Go, Databases, REST APIs, CI pipelines in Groovy, FreeBSD.

### What makes me grumpy?
Inconsistent APIs and naming, non-normalized databases, colleagues that are not dedicated.

* My favorite baked good: Bananenbrood
* My daily driver: Fedora on a Lenovo Thinkpad with FreeBSD VMs
* My favourite beer: Difficult question.. La Chouffe, Tripel Karmeliet.
